# Code Jedi ü´≥üèΩ‚ú®

  <p align="left">
   ‚ú® Code Jedi ‚ú® is a ChatGPT integrated mobile app, which allows users to ask coding related questions to GPT 3.5 Turbo, through a mobile interface. This project was my first experience with React Native and it is the first mobile app, I have ever built.

## Running the App locally üöÄ

In order to run this app on your local smartphone, install React Native, clone the repository and use Expo, to access the app on your phone. To connect a GPT model to the app, you will have to get an API key for the OpenAI API.

Follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- Install the React Native CLI:

  ```bash
  npm install -g react-native-cli
  ```

  <br/>

- Install Expo CLI:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

### 2. Clone the Repository

git clone [URL_OF_YOUR_REPOSITORY]
cd [REPOSITORY_NAME]

### 3. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

### 4. Setup the OpenAI API Key:

- Create an account or login to OpenAI.
- Get your API key from the OpenAI dashboard.
- Create a secrets.js file in the root of the project and add the following:

```javascript
export const apiKey = "[YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY]";
```

Replace [YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY] with the actual API key.
